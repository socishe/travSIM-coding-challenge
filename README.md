# Back-end developer coding challenge: C++

This is a C++ program that allows the user to maintain a Book Record. This is done by firstly inputing a student data like a student name and the marks they have got in the exam e.g "*Sihle 80*". 
The program promps the user to first enter the number of students they going to capture on the system. That data is being stored in a file called "scores.txt". 
Then the function calculateTotalScore() is called when you want to get the marks of any student captured in the file/Book Record.
## Example data stored in Record
 1. Sihle 80
 1. Alex 63
 1. Bob 85
 1. Natali 49
 1. Micki 69

 Now to get the marks of Bob on the record you'd type Bob and 85 would be returned as the exam score Bob got.
